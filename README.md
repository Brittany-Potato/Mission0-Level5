# Wireframe project
This project was designed and built as per the wireframe we recieved. This website was created for the Market Association New Zealand to help promote what they do and make it easier for people to learn about them.

To set the website up you can clone the repo at: https://github.com/Brittany-Potato/Mission0-Level5.git

Then you will want to do npm install.

To see how the project looks just run "npm run dev" hold the ctrl key and click the link that presents after 'Local:'

There are 3 cards at the bottom that allow people to navigate to specific areas of interest.
The search bar allows people to search for more specific areas of interest, and the navbar at the top gives even more option to the website user.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
